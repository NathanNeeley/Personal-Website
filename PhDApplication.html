<p>I decided early in college to pursue a career as a music theorist, which meant eventually attaining a PhD. As I began researching theory programs and preparing application materials, I noticed there were few resources that advised or showed successful graduate theory applications. Although graduate theory admissions are somewhat subjective between programs, I created this web page to provide materials from what I believe to be a fairly successful PhD application. Hopefully, these resources prove to be advantageous for other theory applicants who are aimlessly searching for help with theory applications with no luck. My application materials are provided below, including my professional CV, transcripts, GRE scores, and personal statements, among other idiosyncratic materials requested by certain programs, as well as the letters and financial aid offers from the schools I was accepted to matriculate in fall 2019. I should also mention that I submitted two papers which have been omitted here but are available under the M.M Porfolio section in the research tab; they are entitled "Treatment of Transpositional Combination and Contour: Analogous Realization of Nonserial and Serial Materials in Stravinsky's <i>Septet</i>" and "Reconsidering Chordal Connections and Hierarchy in the Music of Charles Ives: A Transformational Mod-7 Perspective" for reference. Also, I decided to use a two-part invention and chorale melody harmonization to demonstrate tonal expertise since my papers showed mostly familiarity within a 20th-century and atonal idiom.
<br>
<br>
    Additionally, I should also mention that while applying to PhD programs, I was a M.M. student in music theory at the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music, where I was a teaching assistant who taught through the undergraduate core theory and musicianship sequence. Being enrolled in a graduate program while concurrently applying to PhD programs provided me with a community of graduate students and faculty able to offer a constant source of feedback and intellectual stimulation, contributing to the success of my PhD interviews. Furthermore, teaching afforded me invaluable experience crafting my keyboard abilities and aural skills, ultimately, uniquily preparing me to use these abilities at grad interviews/auditions.
